The directory utils/ contains various scripts and other
utilities that may be useful for the development, testing
or deployment of this project.

These utilities may or may not be documented, and many of
them are of ad hoc design, meant for one time uses.

build.sh will mark all utilities that are documented as
executable during the build process.
